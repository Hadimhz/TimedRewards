# TimedRewards
##### The ultimate timed rewards plugin with no clutter.
---

This plugin gives you the ability to create unlimited TimeRewards, providing no UI the plugin registers a bunch of placeholders that give you full control over it, utilizing plugins like [DeluxeMenus](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/deluxemenus.11734/) 

You can download this plugin off of spigot [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/timed-rewards-%E2%9C%A8player-rewards.119467/)!

#### Why no interface? I sense you ask
Well, the reason is realistically quite simple, making a widely configurable interface is no easy task, and even then it would not give you the ability to customize it to your liking.
That's why it's fully up to you to create whatever interface you wish to create.
I mean... Look what you can create using simple DeluxMenus configs.

### Supervisor:

This plugin uses [cjcameron92/supervisor](https://github.com/cjcameron92/supervisor)'s [solo-dev](https://github.com/cjcameron92/supervisor/tree/dev-solo) branch as of `Sep-8-2024`, by the time you're reading this, that branch, or at least the current changes on it, would have already been merged into main version.

Supervisor is inspired by Spring Boot, the Framework is designed to be both expandable and modular, making it the perfect choice for developing robust Minecraft Spigot plugins.

From my personal experience... which I guess is bias being one of it's developer, it really makes life that much easier. Allowing the creation of this plugin in only 521 lines of code (ignoring white spaces)

Of course other utilities were used like [Aikar](https://github.com/aikar)'s [Annotation Command Framework](https://github.com/aikar/commands), ACF for short and [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/).
